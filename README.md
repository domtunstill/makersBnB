# makersBnB

makersBnB is a system for users to list and view spaces that can be booked for staying overnight.

## Motivation

## MVP

Users can sign in/sign out and create listings for spaces. Users can view a list of their spaces.

## User Stories

## Any signed-up user can list a new space.

### User Story 1
```
As a user,
so that guests can view my space,
I need to be able to list a new space.
```

### User Story 2
```
As a user,
so that my space is listed as mine,
I need to be able to sign up with username and email.
```

## Users can list multiple spaces.

### User Story 3
```
As a user,
so that I can have more than one space listed,
I need to be able to post multiple spaces and view these on my account.
```

## Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.

### User Story 4
```
As a user,
so that guests can see information about the space,
I need to be able to add descriptive information for the space: name, description and price.
```

## Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
### User Story 5
```
As a user,
so that guests can see if the space is available when they would like it,
I need to be able to add a range dates the space is available.
```

## Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
