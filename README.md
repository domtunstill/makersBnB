so that guests can view my space,
I need to be able to list a new space.

As a user,
so that my space is listed as mine,
I need to be able to sign up with username and email.

As a user,
so that I can have more than one space listed,
I need to be able to post multiple spaces and view these on my account.
```

### Spaces have a name, description, price and available dates

```
As a user,
so that guests can see information about the space,
I need to be able to add descriptive information for the space: name, description and price.

## Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.

As a user,
